Guidance: The 'reference cargo capacity' in a vessel inspection certificate is an approximate design value for cargo with a certain stowage factor and serves only as a reference; it cannot be the sole basis for finding overloading. Overloading under maritime safety terminology means the vessel's actual total load (cargo, fuel, water, stores) exceeds the applicable loadline such that freeboard is insufficient and the vessel is unseaworthy.

Guidance: Neither vessel may invoke the violated agreement alone or COLREGs alone to aggravate the other's fault or reduce its own. Courts should apply COLREGs as the fundamental standard, consider the content of the parties' agreement, comprehensively analyze how the close-quarters situation arose and whether maneuvers were appropriate, and then assess fault. Where vessels consensually agree to 'green-to-green' passing (violating give-way obligations), both assume equal responsibility to navigate with special caution; subsequent failure by both to keep proper lookout and take timely collision-avoidance action results in equal fault.",

Guidance: Public entertainment venue operators owe a safety duty within reasonable limits, assessed by three principles: (1) Industry/common-sense standard—comply with applicable safety codes or, absent specific standards, meet risks foreseeable to a diligent manager or ordinary person; (2) General safety assurance—provide safety measures necessary and objectively feasible given current operational capacity, not unlimited protection for all consumer demands; (3) Self-protection principle—participants and their guardians bear their own duty of care for normally foreseeable risks. When a barrier (20cm high threshold) meets height standards but lacks complete warning markings (only partial yellow-black stripes, not on all surfaces), the operator has some fault; but when an elderly participant focused on the attraction rather than watching his step and adult companions failed to assist or remind, comparative fault applies heavily against the participant.",

A 20cm threshold for bumper-car containment is reasonable in height; incomplete warning markings (missing on metal attachment strip) show some negligence. (2) Did the operator provide general safety assurance feasible under current conditions? Requiring staff to individually remind and assist every elderly visitor exceeds reasonable expectations and operational capacity. (3) Did the participant and companions exercise self-protection? An elderly person choosing to participate in an activity bears responsibility to assess his own capability; adult family members accompanying an elderly parent owe a duty to remind and assist; inattention by both (participant focused on cars, not footing; companions not assisting) is the primary cause.

      "problem": "Issue: When parties enter into a 'proxy purchase contract' for steel with one party providing funding and earning fixed monthly returns regardless of actual delivery, while funds circulate in a closed loop among affiliates, is the legal relationship a sale/agency or inter-enterprise lending? In such disguised transactions, does the nominal 'transfer of ownership' truly occur, and who bears the risk of goods? When a trustee fails to adequately perform duties under a subsequent 'commission agreement' to recover losses, under what conditions is the trustee liable for the principal's damages? Guidance: Identify simulated acts (通谋虚伪行为) by examining: (1) contract substance (fixed return vs. resale profit), (2) genuine goods flow (closed-loop funds, no real transfer), (3) risk allocation (all risk on nominal buyer). If the arrangement is actually inter-enterprise lending disguised as trade financing, the hidden legal relationship (loan) governs; stipulations on 'goods ownership transfer' are merely façade to maintain the sale appearance and do not cause actual transfer. For trustee liability under PRC Contract Law Art. 406 (now Civil Code Art. 929), assess: (1) whether trustee's conduct constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct, (2) whether principal suffered ascertainable loss, (3) whether causal link exists between trustee's breach and the loss. If the loss stems from third-party wrongdoing (e.g., warehouse operator's fraudulent pledge) rather than trustee's inaction, no causal link exists; trustee may be liable only for incremental losses (e.g., statute-of-limitations loss) directly caused by delay in asserting rights.",

Step 2: Determine whether goods/ownership actually transferred. In simulated sale-loan arrangements, stipulations on delivery and ownership transfer are part of the façade; apply优势证据 (preponderance of evidence): if evidence shows (i) the 'buyer' (borrower) retained control of goods in warehouse, (ii) 'buyer' claimed ownership in third-party litigation, (iii) original legal representative of 'buyer' stated goods remained under 'buyer' despite documents showing transfer—goods/ownership never truly moved; even if documents appear to show transfer, treat as constructive delivery (指示交付) completed in favor of buyer/borrower, who bears all risk per the hidden loan agreement. Step 3: Assess trustee's liability under commission agreement. For breach of duty by trustee (e.g., failing to file lawsuit as instructed), apply Contract Law Art. 406: (a) Trustee liable only for loss caused by intent or gross negligence; (b) Principal must prove ascertainable loss; (c) Causal link required. If goods were lost due to warehouse operator's independent fraud (pledging goods without authority), that loss is not caused by trustee's inaction; principal retains right to sue wrongdoer directly. Trustee may be liable for delay-related losses (e.g., extended interest, potential statute expiry) if trustee's inaction materially delayed principal's remedies—but such loss must be quantified; if principal has not yet exhausted other remedies, the quantum of trustee-caused loss is indeterminate and should be reserved for separate proceedings. Step 4: In debt-assignment cases, if law firm accepts assignment of creditor's claim against the 'lender' (who was actually lender, not seller), re-characterize the claim as return of loan principal (not refund of 'purchase price'); original obligor is the actual borrower (not the 'lender'), and guarantors remain liable per guarantee agreements."

Guidance: Distinguish the external relationship (joint and several liability to the victim) from the internal relationship (proportional shares among partners). A victim's unilateral discharge of one joint obligor's external liability does not alter the internal proportional obligations among partners. When one partner pays more than his internal share, he retains the right to recourse from co-partners for their respective shares, and the discharged partner cannot use the victim's discharge as a defense against recourse—the discharge affects only the victim-obligor relationship, not inter-obligor recourse rights.",

Under General Principles Art. 35, partners engaged in partnership business bear joint and several liability for partnership debts and torts. Here, both partners jointly owned the vehicle; the tort occurred during partnership business; court judgment confirmed their joint and several liability to victim for RMB 66,590.77. Step 2: Analyze the victim-Partner B settlement. In 2000, Partner B paid victim RMB 11,000; victim's agent signed agreement stating victim 'will not require Partner B to continue bearing liability and other joint liability.' This discharge was made without notice to Partner A and does not bind Partner A. Key: victim retains full claim against Partner A for entire remaining debt (not reduced by Partner B's payment). Step 3: Analyze the victim-Partner A settlement. In 2011, Partner A paid victim RMB 102,000 (remaining principal plus accumulated delay-performance interest). Victim and Partner A expressly agreed: 'Partner A reserves right to recourse against Partner B for Partner B's share.' This confirms victim did not truly discharge total debt, only allowed Partner B to stop being pursued. Step 4: Determine internal shares. Partners' 1997 withdrawal-of-capital agreement stipulated: 'For the 1997-06-02 accident, both parties bear half each.' This is a valid internal allocation. Step 5: Calculate recourse amount. Partner A paid total RMB 102,000 (after deducting Partner B's RMB 11,000). Under internal 50-50 split, each should bear half of total debt. Court calculates: original judgment principal + legitimate delay interest, allocate 50-50, then deduct what each has paid; Partner A's overpayment = amount Partner A can recourse from Partner B. Step 6: Reject 'discharge as defense' argument. Partner B argues victim discharged him, so he owes nothing. Reject: (a) Victim's discharge affects only victim's right to pursue Partner B; does not extinguish Partner B's internal obligation to Partner A. (b) Recourse right arises from internal share agreement and law of joint obligations, independent of victim's enforcement choice. (c) If discharge could bar recourse, it would enable one partner to externalize his share onto co-partner via side deal with victim—unjust and contrary to partnership equity.

This relief was already granted in 2004 judgment; requesting same relief violates CPL Art. 108(1)(iv) (no litigation over matters already decided).

Developer seeks RMB 1,764,719.26 for Person A & B's occupancy from Dec. 16, 2004 to Dec. 31, 2009 (enforcement period).

Step 4: Apply CPL Art. 229 & SPC Opinion Art. 295. CPL Art. 229 governs enforcement when judgment debtor fails to perform non-monetary obligation; court may compel performance or order compensatory measures. SPC Opinion Art. 295 clarifies: when judgment debtor delays performance of non-monetary obligation, judgment creditor should request relief (including compensation for delay) from the enforcement court within the enforcement proceeding, not file new lawsuit. Rationale: enforcement court has authority over execution matters, including remedies for non-compliance; duplicative litigation wastes resources and risks conflicting rulings. Step 5: Bankruptcy context does not alter procedural rule. Developer entered bankruptcy in 2005; bankruptcy administrator took over in 2007. Bankruptcy does not create exception to CPL Art. 229; administrator must pursue occupancy-fee claim in enforcement proceeding.

Step 2: Identify seller's disclosure duty. Sales contract stated vehicle is 'new' with only 18km mileage. Vehicle actually underwent repair (right-side sheet metal, repainting, parts replacement) on Jan. 17, 2007 before Feb. 28 delivery. Material defect: repaired vehicle ≠ 'new' vehicle. Seller has duty to disclose. Step 3: Assess whether seller disclosed. Seller claims: (a) price discount (151,900 → 138,000) and gifts prove disclosure. Reject: discounts/gifts are standard sales practices, not proof of disclosure. (b) Delivery receipt signed by buyer notes 'right-side body repair, sold at agreed price.' Reject: receipt held solely by seller, disputed by buyer, written by different persons in remark column—insufficient to prove buyer knew of repair at time of signing. Conclusion: seller failed to disclose, concealed defect. Step 4: Determine if concealment = fraud. Seller knew of repair, intentionally withheld information, buyer relied on 'new car' representation, buyer suffered loss (paid new-car price for repaired car). Fraud established. Step 5: Apply CPL Art. 49 remedies. Consumer may: (a) rescind contract; (b) obtain refund of purchase price RMB 138,000; (c) recover incidental losses (tax, service fee, insurance); (d) obtain double damages = RMB 138,000.

      "problem": "Issue: When a taxi company and driver sign both a labor contract and a contracting operation contract, with a supplemental agreement stipulating that all traffic accident losses exceeding insurance coverage shall be borne entirely by the driver, is such clause enforceable? After the company pays third-party tort damages arising from an accident caused by the driver on duty, may the company recover the full amount from the driver? Does the existence of an employment relationship affect risk allocation? Guidance: Courts must assess whether risk-shifting clauses in employment-based contracting arrangements violate the principles of fairness and freedom of contract. When (1) an employment relationship exists, (2) the accident occurred during performance of duties, (3) the employer unilaterally procured insurance without consulting the driver on coverage amounts, and (4) operating risk is inherent to the employer's taxi business, clauses that shift all risk beyond insurance to the employee are unfair and contrary to Contract Law principles of equality and fairness.

Despite contracting agreement, parties also signed labor contract; driver was confirmed as company employee in prior court judgment; employment relationship exists. Step 2: Identify operating-risk allocation. Taxi company's core business is operating taxis; traffic accident risk is inherent operating risk that employer should bear as part of business. Contracting agreement itself states company 'bears main operating risk and corresponding legal liability.' Step 3: Assess fairness of supplemental agreement clause. Clause stipulates 'all losses exceeding insurance coverage borne entirely by driver.' Analyze: (a) All vehicle insurance handled solely by company without consulting driver on coverage amounts; (b) Driver had no say in insurance procurement or risk management; (c) Clause shifts all operating risk (company's inherent business risk) onto driver (employee); (d) Contradicts company's own promise in main contract to bear 'main operating risk.' Step 4: Apply fairness principle. Contract Law Art. 3 requires equality; Art. 5 requires fairness. Risk-shifting clause in employment context (not arm's-length commercial contracting) violates both: employer uses superior bargaining position to impose standard-form clause transferring its business risk to employee. Such clause is unenforceable. Step 5: Assess driver fault and appropriate indemnity. Driver caused accident through negligence while on duty (full liability in traffic accident). Under employment relationship, employer bears vicarious liability to third parties but may seek partial indemnity from employee based on fault. Calculate 'appropriate' indemnity considering: (a) driver's fault degree (full liability = serious negligence), (b) employer's insurance procurement duty (company chose low coverage without consulting driver), (c) fairness principle. Court discretion: approximately 30% of excess loss = appropriate indemnity."

Should the appellate court support such appeal? Guidance: Judicial clarification is a procedural safeguard ensuring parties understand their rights. When a trial court properly clarifies a party's right to request penalty adjustment and the party explicitly waives that right, the waiver is binding.

        "judgment_guidance": "Step 1: Determine if breach and penalty clause exist. Contract stipulated: delay in payment triggers penalty at 0.3% per day on overdue amount. Defendant delayed payment of RMB 50,000; breach established. Penalty clause valid and enforceable. Step 2: Assess whether penalty is prima facie excessive. Contract rate 0.3%/day = ~110% per year, significantly exceeding statutory interest rates and typical commercial lending rates. Penalty appears excessive on face. Step 3: Evaluate trial court's judicial clarification. Under Contract Law Art. 114, breaching party may request court to adjust excessive penalty. Trial court has duty to clarify this right when penalty appears excessive. Here, trial court expressly clarified defendant's right to request adjustment and inquired whether defendant wished to do so. Defendant explicitly stated: 'do not request adjustment of penalty.' This is a clear, informed waiver. Step 4: Assess binding effect of waiver. Judicial clarification ensures parties make informed choices; once informed choice is made, it binds the party. Defendant cannot strategically waive the right at trial (hoping for favorable judgment) then reassert it on appeal (after unfavorable judgment). Such flip-flopping would: (a) waste judicial resources, (b) undermine trial court's authority, (c) reward strategic manipulation, (d) violate good faith principle. Step 5: Apply appellate review standard. Appellate court reviews trial court's procedure and substance. Procedure: trial court properly clarified; defendant made informed waiver. Substance: given waiver, trial court correctly applied contractual penalty rate without adjustment. Defendant's appeal ground ('penalty excessive') was already raised and waived at trial; no new facts or legal errors shown. Conclusion: Dismiss appeal. General rule: When trial court properly clarifies right to request penalty adjustment and party explicitly waives, appellate court should not entertain subsequent appeal on penalty-excessive grounds absent exceptional circumstances (e.g., newly discovered evidence, trial court coercion, fundamental fairness concerns not addressed by waiver)."

Does such strategic breach violate the good faith principle and justify full enforcement of the penalty? Guidance: Distinguish compensatory penalties (aimed solely at loss indemnity) from punitive penalties (aimed at both indemnity and punishment of breach). Assess whether the breaching party acted with subjective bad faith: if the party voluntarily agreed to high penalty to obtain concrete benefit (preservation relief), obtained that benefit, then deliberately breached, such conduct demonstrates malicious intent and violates good faith.

        ],
        "judgment_guidance": "Step 1: Determine penalty nature—compensatory vs. punitive. Contract Law Art. 114 allows courts to adjust penalties based on actual loss. Penalties are primarily compensatory (loss indemnity) but may be punitive (indemnity + punishment). Here, settlement agreement stipulated RMB 800,000 penalty for breach of obligation to pay RMB 2,772,857.4. Creditor's actual loss = financial cost of unpaid RMB 2.77 million. Penalty RMB 800,000 exceeds typical financial cost (interest), thus has punitive component beyond mere indemnity. Penalty is punitive. Step 2: Assess whether penalty adjustment is appropriate. Under Contract Law Art. 114(2) and SPC Interpretation (II) Art. 29, courts may reduce excessive penalties. Standard: penalty significantly exceeds actual loss. However, adjustment is discretionary; courts consider multiple factors including: (a) loss amount, (b) breach fault/intent, (c) good faith. Step 3: Evaluate debtor's subjective bad faith. Timeline: (i) 2016 Aug: First-instance judgment for creditor RMB 5.28 million; (ii) Debtor appealed; creditor obtained asset preservation (account freeze); (iii) 2016 Oct: During appeal, debtor proposed settlement with high penalty clause; (iv) Debtor paid first installment RMB 3 million; (v) Creditor lifted preservation per agreement; debtor withdrew appeal; (vi) Debtor then failed to pay remaining RMB 2.77 million by agreed deadline. Analysis: Debtor is sophisticated commercial entity; debtor voluntarily offered settlement with RMB 800,000 penalty to induce creditor to lift freeze; debtor obtained benefit (unfrozen accounts, avoided appellate litigation) by first payment; after obtaining benefit, debtor deliberately breached remaining obligation. Such conduct shows strategic manipulation: use settlement to lift preservation, then default after preservation gone. This violates Contract Law Art. 6 good faith principle. Step 4: Apply good faith principle to penalty adjustment. When breach is malicious/strategic (not mere inability to pay), full penalty enforcement serves both compensation and deterrence. Reducing penalty would reward bad faith and encourage strategic breach. Court discretion: refuse to reduce penalty despite high amount, given debtor's malicious intent. Conclusion: Full RMB 800,000 penalty upheld. General rule: Courts may refuse penalty reduction under Art. 114 when breaching party: (a) voluntarily agreed to high penalty to obtain specific benefit in settlement, (b) obtained that benefit, (c) then deliberately breached after obtaining benefit, demonstrating subjective bad faith and violation of good faith principle."

When a long-term cooperative contract requiring mutual trust and voluntary participation reaches deadlock (breaching party refuses performance of non-monetary obligations unsuitable for specific performance, parties lose cooperation basis, contract purpose defeated), courts may terminate contract rights and obligations per Civil Code Art. 580 but breaching party bears breach liability including partial forfeiture of pre-paid fees.",

Here: (a) Urban Blue Line Management Measures effective since 2006, not new law; (b) blue line designated along existing mountain river already present at contract formation; (c) blue line designation = foreseeable regulatory adjustment, not unforeseeable fundamental change; (d) blue line covers only small portion of 595.88-hectare operating area; (e) even within blue line, development permissible after administrative approval per policy; (f) tourism company never applied for required approvals, never obtained prohibition notice. Conclusion: blue line designation does not constitute change of circumstances. Village committee not in breach. Tourism company breaching by abandoning performance. Step 2: Determine if contract deadlock justifies termination. Contract characteristics: (i) 50-year term, (ii) cooperative nature (village provides land/infrastructure, company develops and operates, parties share future tourism revenue), (iii) company's development obligation = non-monetary debt unsuitable for specific performance. Deadlock facts: (a) company withdrew from site, (b) company explicitly refuses to develop/operate, (c) village demands continued performance, (d) parties lost mutual trust and cooperation basis, (e) contract purpose (tourism development and revenue sharing) defeated. Civil Code Art. 580 analysis: Company's refusal to develop = non-performance of non-monetary debt. Circumstances triggering Art. 580(2) termination: (i) debt unsuitable for specific performance (long-term cooperative development requires company's active participation and expertise; cannot be compelled), (ii) inability to achieve contract purpose (without company's development, no tourism revenue for either party; village cannot find substitute easily given 50-year commitment). Apply Art. 580(2): court may terminate contract rights/obligations at party's request when non-monetary debt unsuitable for specific performance and contract purpose defeated, but termination does not affect breach liability. Step 3: Calculate restitution and breach damages. Upon termination, restitution principle applies: company paid RMB 3 million cooperation fee; no actual development occurred. However, company is breaching party; Art. 580(2) expressly states termination 'does not affect breach liability.' Village incurred: land clearance/tenant compensation, electrical system upgrades, taxes, lost opportunity cost (50-year contract term, time needed to find new partner). Court discretion: balance restitution (company entitled to return of fee for non-performance) against breach damages (village's actual expenditures, lost expectation interest).酌定 partial refund RMB 1.2 million (40% of fee), effectively imposing RMB 1.8 million breach liability. General rule: When long-term cooperative contract unsuitable for specific performance reaches deadlock (breaching party abandons, non-breaching party demands performance, cooperation basis lost), court may terminate per Civil Code Art. 580(2) but breaching party liable for damages offsetting restitution."
