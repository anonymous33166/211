Guidance: The 'reference cargo capacity' in a vessel inspection certificate is an approximate design value for cargo with a certain stowage factor and serves only as a reference; it cannot be the sole basis for finding overloading. Overloading under maritime safety terminology means the vessel's actual total load (cargo, fuel, water, stores) exceeds the applicable loadline such that freeboard is insufficient and the vessel is unseaworthy.

      "problem": "Issue: When two vessels agree by radio to navigate in a manner contrary to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGs) and subsequently collide, how should courts allocate fault? May either party rely solely on the other's breach of the agreement or solely on COLREGs duties to shift liability? Guidance: Neither vessel may invoke the violated agreement alone or COLREGs alone to aggravate the other's fault or reduce its own. Courts should apply COLREGs as the fundamental standard, consider the content of the parties' agreement, comprehensively analyze how the close-quarters situation arose and whether maneuvers were appropriate, and then assess fault. Where vessels consensually agree to 'green-to-green' passing (violating give-way obligations), both assume equal responsibility to navigate with special caution; subsequent failure by both to keep proper lookout and take timely collision-avoidance action results in equal fault.",

What is the scope of a freight forwarder's duty and liability when the shipper requests the forwarder to stop delivery or return goods in transit? Guidance: A transport document other than a B/L can evidence a contract of carriage only if it embodies mutual intent to contract for carriage. An FCR bearing an express disclaimer of carrier status and issued in the context of a FOB sale (where the buyer arranges transport) is merely a cargo receipt, not proof of a carriage contract.

Guidance: Individual employment relationships arising from commercial and profit-making activities (as opposed to household services) are governed by strict employer liability under the SPC Personal Injury Interpretation Art. 11; the employer is liable regardless of fault. 'Forum court location' in Art. 25 refers to the institutional seat of the court that accepted the case, not to any branch tribunal that may hear it; for specialized courts with multi-provincial jurisdiction, use the statistical data of the municipality where the court's headquarters is located (e.g., a separately planned municipality).",

What standard should courts apply to determine whether a responsible party acted with intent or 'recklessly with knowledge that damage would probably result'? Guidance: The right to limit maritime liability is lost when the responsible party (owner/operator) personally acted with intent or recklessly with knowledge that loss would probably result. Long-term, repeated serious violations (ultra vires navigation, no clearances, unlicensed operation, undermanning) combined with fleeing after collision demonstrate that the responsible party knew such conduct would likely cause loss yet continued to act or omit action recklessly.

Post-collision flight without rescue or reporting, when the owner was informed and failed to order proper response, further demonstrates reckless disregard.

Guidance: Under Contract Law Arts. 97 and 248, upon termination for lessee's material breach, the lessor may reclaim the leased vessel and claim damages for continued unlawful occupation. To avoid forced appraisal/auction in a depressed market with severe vessel depreciation, courts may allow the lessor to claim use fees at the contractual rental rate from termination until actual return.

Apply contractual setoff order: (1) fees, (2) penalties, (3) damages, (4) rent, (5) purchase price. Deposits converted to advance rent and partial payments should offset arrears in reverse chronological order (most recent periods first) unless contract specifies otherwise. Asset management fees agreed in supplemental contracts are enforceable if within the scope of the finance lease transaction.
